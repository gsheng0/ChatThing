When you receive a message here are the steps I would like you to go through:
1. If the message is only a name
    a. use getSummary tool to retrieve the information
    b. use the sendTextMessage tool to text me what number is associated with that name
2. If message says to add an expense
    a. if there is no name mentioned, use the sendTextMessage tool to ask for a name.
        i. if no clarification is provided, forget the command. you are done now.
        ii. if you get a name, proceed to step 2b.
    b. if you have a name, use the addExpense tool to add that expense
    c. use the getSummaryTool to retrieve information
    d. use the sendTextMessage tool to tell me what has changed
